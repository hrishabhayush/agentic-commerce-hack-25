Subject: FlowMetrics Q1 2024 Investor Update: Striking Growth and Market Performance

Dear Investor,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm thrilled to share FlowMetrics' Q1 2024 performance insights, which reflect our continued success and escalating growth trajectory in the e-commerce analytics market. 

In the past quarter alone, our Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) surged by an impressive 25.1% to stand at $233,333. This substantial increase, sourced directly from our Stripe API, bolsters our confidence in FlowMetrics' scalable business model and affirms our strategic growth initiatives. 

Our customer base, which now exceeds 450 businesses, is another testament to our value proposition. Our pricing tiers, ranging from $199 to $999 per month, cater to a wide array of e-commerce businesses, demonstrating our robust and flexible solution offerings. 

Notably, our platform's user engagement metrics also indicate a positive trend. Daily Active Users (DAU) have increased by 22.4%, bringing the count to 1,247 users. This data, sourced from Mixpanel API, suggests that we are not only acquiring new customers but also successfully retaining and engaging existing ones. 

Looking at the market potential, we see significant opportunities for further growth. The SMB WooCommerce market presents a potential ARR of $420,000, according to news API intelligence. This insight underscores the substantial room for expansion that lies ahead for FlowMetrics. 

Our QoQ growth of 25%, $2.8M ARR, and the increasing adoption of our analytics platform by e-commerce businesses, paint a promising picture of FlowMetrics' future. 

We are extremely grateful for your continued support and belief in our vision. As we forge ahead, we remain committed to maximizing shareholder value and harnessing the burgeoning market opportunity in e-commerce analytics. 

We invite you to join us in our upcoming investor call, where we will discuss our strategies to capture this market potential and maintain our strong growth momentum.

Thank you once again for your support. 

Best Regards,
