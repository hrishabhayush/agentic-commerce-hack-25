# 🧠 Enhanced Graph Visualization System

## Overview

This enhanced graph system transforms your complex semantic graph into **intuitive, audience-specific insights** that actually tell you what matters for different stakeholders.

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### ✅ Problems Solved
- **Too many meaningless edges**: Now filters to show only significant relationships
- **Unclear audience relevance**: Automatically categorizes insights by stakeholder (investors, customers, etc.)
- **No actionable insights**: Generates specific recommendations for each audience
- **Difficult navigation**: Provides multiple filtered views and interactive exploration

### 🚀 New Features
1. **Smart Edge Filtering**: Only shows relationships above 0.3 semantic similarity
2. **Audience-Specific Views**: Separate graphs for investors, customers, internal team, developers
3. **Insight Clustering**: Groups related insights with priority levels
4. **Actionable Recommendations**: Tells you what to do with each insight cluster
5. **Interactive Dashboard**: Filter and explore data dynamically

## 🔧 Running the System

### Quick Start
```bash
# Generate enhanced visualizations
python graphs/enhanced_visualizer.py

# Launch interactive dashboard  
streamlit run graphs/interactive_dashboard.py
```

- **Node Types**: Filter metrics vs insights
- **Connection Strength**: Hide weak relationships
- **Real-time Filtering**: Adjust parameters and see results instantly

## 📋 Understanding Your Data

### Insight Clusters
The system automatically creates **insight clusters** - groups of related data points that tell a story:

```json
{
  "name": "Financial Opportunity Analysis",
  "priority": "high", 
  "audience": "investors",
  "key_metrics": ["MRR grew 25.1%", "DAU grew 22.4%"],
  "actionable_insights": [
    "Highlight growth metrics in investor updates",
    "Emphasize positive performance trends"
  ]
}
```

### Priority Levels
- **High**: Business-critical insights requiring immediate attention
- **Medium**: Important trends worth monitoring  
- **Low**: Contextual information for completeness

## 🎛️ Customization

### Adjust Filtering Thresholds
In `enhanced_visualizer.py`:
```python
# Make edges more/less selective
def filter_meaningful_edges(self):
    if edge['semantic_similarity'] < 0.3:  # Lower = more edges
        continue
    if edge['weight'] < 0.35:  # Lower = more edges  
        continue
```

### Add New Audiences
```python
self.audiences = {
    "your_audience": {
        "keywords": ["relevant", "terms", "here"],
        "color": "#HEX_COLOR"
    }
}
```

### Modify Importance Scoring
```python
def calculate_node_importance(self, node):
    # Adjust scoring logic here
    if abs(value) >= 10:  # Change threshold
        score += 2
```
